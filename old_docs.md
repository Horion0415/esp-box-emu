## Description

This project is a little retro game emulation system running on ESP32-S3-BOX. It
is built using the following:

- [ESPP](http://github.com/esp-cpp/espp)
- [LVGL](http://github.com/lvgl/lvgl)
- [Squareline Studio](http://squareline.io) (for designing and generating LVGL)
- Nofrendo (NES emulator)
- GNUBoy (GB / GBC emulator)

## Videos

### Gameboy Color

This video shows settings page (with audio control and video scaling control), and then Links Awakening DX. While running the ROMs, the video scaling can be toggled through the three options (Original, Fit, and Fill) using the BOOT button on the side of the ESP-S3-BOX and the audio output can be toggled on / off using the MUTE button on the top.

### Support for dynamically loading emulators (TBD)

 Down the line I'd like to add the ability to load the emulator cores from the
 FTP server (which would be pre-compiled ESP32 libraries) so that they wouldn't
 take up as much space on the ESP32 itself. Right now that's not a huge concern
 though because the ESP (S3 module in the ESP BOX especially) has more than
 enough flash for the emulators so assuming their RAM can be managed it won't be
 much of an issue.
 
 Info for loading elf files at runtime:
 https://github.com/niicoooo/esp32-elfloader.
 [Here](https://github.com/joltwallet/jolt_wallet/tree/master/jolt_os/jelf_loader)
 is another implementation.

## Filsystem / Storage

The emu-box supports both on-board FLASH storage through LittleFS (limited to
the 16 MB flash chip in the S3 in the box) as well as support for external FAT
filesystems on a uSD card connected via SPI (this is the DEFAULT option):

| uSD SPI | ESP32 GPIO (exposed via PMOD header) |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| CS      | 10                                   |
| MOSI    | 11                                   |
| MISO    | 13                                   |
| SCLK    | 12                                   |

The storage can be changed via `menuconfig`.

### Using LittleFS (Internal FLASH):

You will need to set up a `flash_data/` folder which contains your roms (.nes,
.gb, .gbc), images (.jpg), and metadata.csv. (See next section for more info
about Rom Images and the metadata file). The contents of this folder will be
flashed into the `littlefs` partition.

At least once, you'll need to update the
[./main/CMakeLists.txt](./main/CMakeLists.txt) to uncomment the line that has
`FLASH_IN_PROJECT` as part of the `littlefs_create_partition_image` command -
this will flash all files in your `flash_data/` folder onto the `littlefs`
partition on the embedded FLASH chip. Alternatively, you can use the
`esptool.py`, `parttool.py` as mentioned in [the SPIFFS
docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/storage/spiffs.html).

### Using FAT (external uSD card):

Format your uSD card as a FAT filesystem and add your roms (.nes, .gb, .gbc),
images (.jpg), and metadata.csv. (See next section for more info about Rom
Images and the metadata file). Make sure the uSD card is plugged into the socket
and the wires are properly connected to the pins (including 3.3V and GND) listed
above.

## ROM Images

For ease of use, there is a
[./boxart/source/resize.bash](./boxart/source/resize.bash) script which will
resize all `jpg` images in the `boxart/source` folder to be 100x px wide (keep
aspect ratio but make width 100 px) and put the resized versions in the `boxart`
folder. You can then copy them onto your sd card and update your metadata file
appropriately.

### Metadata.csv format

``` csv
<rom filename>, <rom boxart filename>, <rom display name>
```

Example:

``` csv
mario.nes, boxart/mario.jpg, Mario Bros.
super_mario_1.nes, boxart/super_mario_bros_1.jpg, Super Mario Bros.
super_mario_3.nes, boxart/super_mario_bros_3.jpg, Super Mario Bros. 3
zelda.nes, boxart/zelda1.jpg, The Legend of Zelda
zelda_2.nes, boxart/zelda2.jpg, The Legend of Zelda 2: the Adventure of Link
mega_man.nes, boxart/megaman1.jpg, MegaMan
metroid.nes, boxart/metroid1.jpg, Metroid
pokemon_blue.gb, boxart/pokemon_blue.jpg, Pokemon Blue
pokemon_red.gb, boxart/pokemon_red.jpg, Pokemon Red
pokemon_yellow.gbc, boxart/pokemon_yellow.jpg, Pokemon Yellow
links_awakening.gb, boxart/tloz_links_awakening.jpg, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening
links_awakening.gbc, boxart/tloz_links_awakening_dx.jpg, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX
```

## References and Inspiration:

### ESP32 S3 Box Info:

It uses GPIO_NUM_46 to control power to the speaker, so if you do not set that
as output HIGH, then you will never hear anything T.T

The ESP32 S3 Box has two PMOD headers, PMOD1 and PMOD2, which have the following
pins:

* PMOD1
  * IO40 (I2C_SCL)
  * IO41 (I2C_SDA)
  * IO38
  * IO39
  * IO42
  * IO21
  * IO19 (USB_D-, U1RTS, ADC2_CH8)
  * IO20 (USB_D+, U1CTS, ADC2_CH9)
* PMOD2
  * IO09 (FSPIHD, TOUCH9, ADC1_CH8)
  * IO10 (FSPICS0, TOUCH10, ADC1_CH9)
  * IO11 (FSPID, TOUCH11, ADC2_CH0)
  * IO12 (FSPICLK, TOUCH12, ADC2_CH1)
  * IO13 (FSPIQ, TOUCH13, ADC2_CH2)
  * IO14 (FSPIWP, TOUCH14, ADC2_CH3)
  * IO44 (U0RXD)
  * IO43 (U0TXD)

#### LCD

The LCD is a ST7789 320x240 BGR display connected via SPI.

ESP32s3 LCD Pinout:

| LCD Function   | ESP I/O Pin |
|----------------|-------------|
| Data / Command | 4           |
| Chip Select    | 5           |
| Serial Data    | 6           |
| Serial Clock   | 7           |
| Reset          | 48          |
| Backlight      | 45          |

#### Touch

The ESP32S3 Box uses a capacitive touch controller connected via I2C.

The touch driver can be either the TT21100 or Ft5x06 chip.

NOTE: it appears the one I have (regular ESP32 S3 BOX) which has the red circle
at the bottom of the display (the `HOME` button) uses the TT21100 chip.

#### Audio

The ESP32s3 Box has a few audio codec coprocessors connected simultaneously to
I2S (data) and I2C (configuration). It uses an encoder codec chip (ES7210) for
audio input from the multiple mics on-board, and a decoder chip (es8311) for
audio output to the speaker (output power controlled by GPIO 46).

ESP32s3 Audio Pinout:

| Audio Function | ESP I/O Pin |
|----------------|-------------|
| I2S MCLK       | 2           |
| I2S SCLK       | 17          |
| I2S LRCK       | 47          |
| I2S Data Out   | 15          |
| I2S Data In    | 16          |
| Speaker Power  | 46          |
| Mute Button    | 1           |

I2C Pinout (shared with touchscreen chip above):

| I2C Function | ESP I/O Pin |
|--------------|-------------|
| SCL          | 18          |
| SDA          | 8           |

### Controllers

#### Sparkfun QwiicNES

The Sparkfun QwiicNES ([product page](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18038),
[library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_QwiicNES_Arduino_Library)) is a
NES controller adapter that supports direct GPIO and I2C. The
[controller](./components/controller) component we have supports direct GPIO
configuration if you choose to use it (find the configuration in the
[./components/box-emu-hal/src/input.cpp](./components/box-emu-hal/src/input.cpp)).

It also however has a ATmega 32u4 which allows it to act as a USB gamepad and
exposes the NES gamepad over I2C as well. For ease of use, the I2C functionality
has been wrapped into a [qwiicnes component](./components/qwiicnes). There is an
example of using this qwiicnes component in the component's example folder.

#### Joy bonnet

The [joy bonnet](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/joy_bonnet) was designed as a
raspberry pi hat which has abxy, start/select, analog joystick, and player 1 /
player 2 buttons. It's useful for prototyping input / hardware and testing how
well the emulators run (by playing them of course ;) )

The joystick is routed out via an ADS1015 I2C ADC chip (addr 0x48), with the
__Y-axis__ mapped to __channel 0__, and the __X-axis__ mapped to __channel 1__.
[see
here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Retrogame/blob/master/joyBonnet.py)

Pinout (pin number is w.r.t. header, not pi GPIO):

| Button  | Joy Bonnet Header Pin Number |
|---------|------------------------------|
| A       | 32                           |
| B       | 31                           |
| X       | 36                           |
| Y       | 33                           |
| Start   | 37                           |
| Select  | 38                           |
| Ground  | 6, 9, 14, 20, 25, 30, 34, 39 |
| 5V      | 2, 4                         |
| 3V3     | 1, 17                        |
| I2C SDA | 3                            |
| I2C SCL | 5                            |
